Project name: High School- Decoded README
Anushka Saran, Helen Wang, Lily Li


Introduction:
Welcome to a high school: a place where many students are burdened with the stress of mounds of homework, test scores, AP classes, SATs, and getting into college. On top of this, students are increasingly distracted from their work by laptops and mobile devices. How can students be expected to keep up with all of their work without getting distracted and still have time to pursue their own interests? Never fear! High School- Decoded? can help students navigate through their murky high school years. With this personalizable high school/college guide app, students can keep track of assignments and events, learn to prioritize, and avoid procrastinating, while at the same time getting ready for college!

Instructions:
Click the start button to open your account on High School- Decoded. When you first open the app, you will be prompted for your grades, classes, activities, and colleges and majors that you are interested in. You can edit these later if you want. Use your mouse to navigate through the app and click on buttons that can perform various operations.

PACKAGE functions:
__________________

9.Activity: This class represents an activity that the user enters in activity window on
	the dashboard
10.Assignment: a assignment that the user has to complete, the user’s time limit for each 
   assignment, points for each assignment 
11.Points: manages the points that the user receives for completing an assignment based on

PACKAGE graphics:
_________________

12.ActivityGui: Gui for the activities window. In this window, the user 
	can create a daily schedule that lists an event/activity and the time it will occur.
	An event/activity can also be deleted, but there is a bug with that(the table will
	create some empty rows at the top of the table, but if you close the window and then
	open it again, the empty rows will disappear and it will work as expected).
13.AssignmentGui: graphics interface for assignments. The user can in
	information about assignments(such as whether it is completed, the subject related to 
	the assignment, due date, the goal amount of time to spend on the assignment, and its
	priority level). The user can also look at a graph that shows the points they have 
	earned over time. When an assignment is selected in the table, a timer (at the 
	bottom)automatically starts and when the assignment is checked off, it is 
	automatically stopped, but it must be reset manually.
	Assignments can also be deleted (but there is a bug with that; the window must be 	closed if an assignment is deleted and then opened again before further use). 
	Points are awarded based on completion of assignments. 
14.ChanceCalculatorGui: graphics for calculating college admission chances given SAT or ACT 	scores
15.ClassesGui: represents the graphics interface for entering classes and grades for those
	classes by the user. This information is then displayed on the Dashboard window under 
	the current grades panel.
16.CollegesGui: graphics interface for college related functions
17.GPACalculatorGui: graphics for calculating unweighted/weighted/finals calculators
18.GradesGui: graphics to add in grades
19.Graph: Takes information from assignments to create a graph of the points earned every
	day
20.MajorGui: graphics to show list of 100 majors
21.ProfileGui: represents the graphics interface for entering information about the user.
	The information is then presented at the top right of the dashboard window.
22.UtilitiesGui: graphics interface for utilities such as a calendar,
